# Overview :-

A sentiment score is assigned to each news article, representing its overall sentiment value.

# What are the benefits :-

Better Decision-making – News sentiment analysis helps investors, businesses and policymakers make informed decisions by providing insights into public opinion and market trends.

Proactive Risk Management – Sentiment analysis can provide advanced notice of a crisis, scandal or public relations fiasco.

# Challanges :-

- Understanding Ambiguity, Sarcasm and Humor –  Interpreting ambiguous, sarcastic or humorous language can be problematic for NLP algorithms.

- Conducting Multilingual Analysis – Analyzing news sentiment in foreign languages requires the same degree of sophisticated NLP techniques and resources for each language. Such capabilities may not be readily available for every language.

- Detecting Bias – News articles can contain biases, which can skew sentiment analysis results. Additionally, algorithms can introduce bias in the analysis process if they are not calibrated appropriately.
